    // 825pm-->832pm ... ridiculously simple
	
	// Problems with this approach:

	//	If Iâ€™m asked to encode the same long URL several times, it will get several entries. That wastes codes and memory.
	//	People can find out how many URLs have already been encoded. Not sure I want them to know.
	//	People might try to get special numbers by spamming me with repeated requests shortly before their desired number comes up.
	//	Only using digits means the codes can grow unnecessarily large. Only offers a million codes with length 6 (or smaller). 
	// 	Using six digits or lower or upper case letters would offer (10+26*2)6 = 56,800,235,584 codes with length 6.
