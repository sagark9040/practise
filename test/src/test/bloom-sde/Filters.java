/*- Given an array like [-1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6] and it should print the 3 that is order of the array is equal to array element

    - Given a positive integer N, write a function to return a list of the first N fibonacci numbers in order. For example, if N=5, the output list is 0 1 1 2 3.

    - GIven a list of strings, return a list of strings of equal length. For each input string, if it is an IPv4 address, output "IPv4". If an IPv6 address, output "IPv6". If neither, output "Neither".
Answer Question

    - Given a list of integers A and an integer k, return the number of unique pairs of integers in A that sum to k. For example, if A=[1 2 5 5 10 8 2] and k=10, the answer is 2, arrived as 5+5 or 2+8. There were 15 tests for this question, with at least the last two timing out, given that the implementation was not as efficient as possible.

- Interview
The interview flow was pretty straight forward - 1. Phone screen ( 3 coding questions - 1 hour long) 2. Onsite - 2 Rounds (2 on 1)- all coding. 
Usually if you are through in the 2 you will have more rounds. Looks like i did not clear them.
Interview Questions

    - Phone Screen -
1. WAP to check if a string is palindrome ( best solution expected )
2. WAP if a number is palindrome ( eg - 12321, again best solution expected )
3. WAP to check if a given binary tree is symmetric or not. - i coded two different ways. Got it right at second attempt as the first one did not satisfy all the test cases.
Onsite -
Interview 1 - 20 mins back ground and questions on your resume. 
What was your contribution and how did you make it better etc. Will check how deeply you know your resume.

    - Problem - Given an Iterator of Iterators (Object - no particular class specified) which is taken in as a stream of input - how will you flatten it and implement an Iterator over it ? Interviewer was very specific that I cannot flatten the whole input in constructor as it is a stream. What different test cases will I consider.
Interview 2 -
10 mins of questions on resume - this time not so deep.
Problem 1 - How will you design and implement tax slab system. He was looking for a method which takes in tax brackets as %s and gives back the tax amount.
Problem 2 - How will you implement a spell check. - This was a Trie implementation. I could not code this completely. Questions about the time and space complexity of the same

- Interview Questions
    - - There was 1 linked list based question and other was a data structure question. Both were simple and i was able to do both of them.. - 1 Design Question - HR questions and some problem solving questions... there were total of 4 rounds.. each round had 2 people and final round was with group head.. Design question was based on how to optimize latency and do some probing question.

- Interview Questions
    - Group strings in vector by anagrams
Answer Question

    - what nearly all stl functions have in common? (iterators as arg)
Answer Question

    - Suppose we have a big company and a lot of job applications every day. How do we solve the problem of finding best position for applicant?

- Interview Questions
    - How do you write an algorithm to count all subsets of strings in a string.

- Write the functionality to design an elevator system.

- Interview Questions
    - Interview 1:
1. virtual functions, inheritance, etc..easy to answer c++ questions. Conversation was for about 20-25 minutes
2. Can't exactly recall, but it was about Binary Search Tree, pretty easy to find on the web. I think it was to do with levels in BST, I used recursion in the solution. Interviewer was happy with the solution. Overall call lasted for about 1 hour and 5 minutes including some questions I asked him.

    - Interview 2:
1. What is mutex, semaphore?
2. What is a singleton pattern and can you write one that is thread-safe
3. Write a consumer producer problem. Producer produces 1000 objects and there are five consumers that consume 10 objects at a time in round robin fashion until all of them are consumed. This means that if consumer 1 consumes 10 objects, it has to wait for consumer 2, 3, 4, 5 to consume 10 objects each before it can consume other 10.
